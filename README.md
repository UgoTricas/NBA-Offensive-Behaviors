This data analysis project explores the evolution of shooting behaviors in the NBA between the 2003â€“2004 and 2023â€“2024 regular seasons.

The analysis relies on detailed public data, available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/nba-shots/data), and highlights spatial, positional, and individual trends through visualizations.

Two notebooks are provided:

* `nba_offensive_behaviors_en.ipynb` : [English version](nba_offensive_behaviors_en.ipynb)
* `nba_offensive_behaviors_fr.ipynb` : [French version](nba_offensive_behaviors_fr.ipynb)
